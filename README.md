can login and create a parcel order and keep track of it till it get to the destination, 
the user will be able to view all the parcels delivered and that which are still in transit
and a user has an option to cancel an order which is still in transit.

status of any parcel when delivered. This is only endpoints that makes and applications (No views are yet applied).
